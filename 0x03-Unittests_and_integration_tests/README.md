# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on writing effective **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python.  
You will learn how to use the **unittest** module, **mocking**, **fixtures**, and **parameterization**, as well as how to design tests that validate both simple functions and interactions with external services.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- The difference between **unit tests** and **integration tests**
- How to use common testing patterns:
  - Mocking
  - Parameterization
  - Fixtures
- How to structure Python test files using `unittest`
- How to test functions, classes, properties, and external API calls

## Requirements

- All code tested will run on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**
- Python version: **3.7**
- All test files must end with a new line
- First line of every file must be:
